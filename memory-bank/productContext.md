# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
VCB addresses the need for a modern, digital coloring experience that combines the creativity of traditional coloring books with the possibilities of AI-generated content. It provides endless variety and eliminates the need for physical coloring books.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Limited Content**: Traditional coloring books have finite pages; AI generation provides unlimited content
2. **Accessibility**: Digital format is accessible anywhere without physical materials
3. **Mess-Free**: No physical crayons, markers, or cleanup required
4. **Reusability**: Digital images can be colored multiple times with different color schemes
5. **Storage**: No physical storage space needed for coloring books

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. **Launch**: User opens the app and sees a clean interface
2. **Load Image**: User clicks "Load Elsa" or generates an AI image via category input
3. **AI Processing**: App generates a line art image (if using AI) or loads Elsa image
4. **Scratch-Off Reveal**: User draws/scratches on canvas to reveal original image underneath white fill
5. **Progress Tracking**: Progress bar shows how much of image has been revealed
6. **Reset**: User can click Reset button to restore white fill and start over
7. **Save**: User can save their revealed work (future feature)
