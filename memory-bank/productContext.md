# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
VCB addresses the need for a modern, digital coloring experience that combines the creativity of traditional coloring books with the possibilities of AI-generated content. It provides endless variety and eliminates the need for physical coloring books.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Limited Content**: Traditional coloring books have finite pages; AI generation provides unlimited content
2. **Accessibility**: Digital format is accessible anywhere without physical materials
3. **Mess-Free**: No physical crayons, markers, or cleanup required
4. **Reusability**: Digital images can be colored multiple times with different color schemes
5. **Storage**: No physical storage space needed for coloring books

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. **Launch**: User opens the app and sees a clean, colorful interface
2. **Generate Image**: User selects a category (animals, vehicles, nature, etc.) or uses a simple prompt
3. **AI Processing**: App generates a line art image suitable for coloring (black outlines on white)
4. **Coloring**: User selects colors from palette and colors the image using brush or fill tools
5. **Save**: User can save their work at any time
6. **Load**: User can return later and continue working on saved images
